First you need to initilize git repo
command : git init

but Now a days React come with pre-built things, 
so you don't need to use git init.

Next command is for status checking

analogy: let say we want to dubai, and we ensure the presence of 
passengers on the report. now to see the status that either passenger is in 
the airport or not, so for that use git status command

command: git status

if you get untracked files as a result of git status then it means that
passengers are not in the airport,  so to bring the passengers to airport
we have to call the passengers

in git languange we have to use git command which is mentioned below

command: git add .

now again check the status by running the git status command

if you get the statements like changes are ready to commit or green files.
then it means it is ready to commit and same like passengers are in the airport 
so before sending passenger to dubai they must take message with theirself

for this use git command : git commit -m "any message";

Now for pushing code to github you need to connect local repo with remote repo


local repo means the folders in which your current project is located
remote repo is the repository you created on github

so for connecting 

command: git remote add origin https://github.<expected URL>

and now push code to this repo 

command: git push -u origin master
